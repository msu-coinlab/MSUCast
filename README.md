# Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm in C++. MOPSO is a heuristic optimization algorithm used to find the best solutions to multi-objective optimization problems.

## Features

- Implemented in modern C++ (C++20)
- Efficient handling of high dimensional spaces

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with support for C++20 (e.g., GCC 10 or newer)
- CMake 3.10 or newer

### Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

### Input

Description of the input the program takes. (e.g., objective function definition, constraints, etc.)

### Output

Description of the output the program produces. (e.g., optimized parameters, objective function values, etc.)

### Example

Provide an example of how to use your program, ideally with code snippets and output.

## Documentation

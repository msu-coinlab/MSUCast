# Contributing to Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) in C++

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MOPSO project! We welcome contributions from everyone. Before getting started, please familiarize yourself with the guidelines below.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Clone your fork locally on your development machine.
- Configure the remotes by adding the original repository as 'upstream'.
  ```
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/gtoscano/SimpleMOPSO
  ```

## Developing

Here are the steps to get you started:

1. Update your fork to the latest version of the original repository.
   ```
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
2. Create a new branch where you will make your changes.
   ```
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```
3. Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards used throughout the project.
4. Test your changes locally to ensure they work correctly and do not introduce new bugs.

## Submitting Changes

Once your changes are ready to be submitted:

1. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
2. Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right branch to compare.
3. Provide a detailed description of the changes in the pull request.
4. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request and provide feedback.
5. Once the pull request is approved, maintainers will merge it.

## Coding Standards

- Ensure code is formatted consistently with the existing code base.
- Include comments explaining any non-trivial pieces of code.
- Update or add documentation for the feature you're working on.
- Write meaningful commit messages. If unsure, refer to [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported or discussed.
2. If not, open a new issue and provide a detailed description.
3. Label the issue appropriately.

## Community

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- Adhere to the project's code of conduct (if available).
